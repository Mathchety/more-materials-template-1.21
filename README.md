## Minecraft 1.21 MOD
---
> This is my first Minecraft Mod project.
- I'm learning from a Mod Developer on Youtube called **Kaupenjoe** [[Kaupenjoe Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ModdingByKaupenjoe/featured)]
- I'm looking for developing a mod that adds more materials to minecraft, not just more ores but more tools using already existing minecraft ores like **Copper** and **Emerald**
---
The **Master** branch is the Kaupenjoe's tutorial,
The 1.21 and 1.21.1 branches are my mod based on the tutorial for the minecraft versions
